Abstract

Since even before the time 
of Alexander Graham Bell’s revolutionary invention, 
engineers and scientists have studied the phenomenon 
of speech communication 
with an eye on creating more efficient and effective systems 
of human-to-human and human-to-machine communication. 

Starting in the 1960s, 
digital signal processing (DSP), 
assumed a central role in speech studies, 
and today DSP is the key to realizing the fruits of the knowledge 
that has been gained through decades of research. 

Concomitant advances in integrated circuit technology and computer architecture 
have aligned to create a technological environment 
with virtually limitless opportunities 
for innovation in speech communication applications. 

In this text, 
we highlight the central role of DSP techniques 
in modern speech communication research and applications. 

We present a comprehensive overview of digital speech processing 
that ranges from the basic nature of the speech signal, 
through a variety of methods of representing speech in digital form, 
to applications in voice communication 
and automatic synthesis and recognition of speech. 

The breadth of this subject does not allow us to discuss any aspect of speech processing to great depth; 
hence our goal is to provide a useful introduction 
to the wide range of important concepts that comprise the ﬁeld of digital speech processing. 

A more comprehensive treatment will appear in the forthcoming book, 
Theory and Application of Digital Speech Processing.
